#   Try 2
#   This algorithm is founded on an observation:
#       If s can create a valid magic array, then splits (an array
#       containing all ways to split s into d elements) itself
#       must contain all 2 * d + 2 sums with d distinct elements.
#       There's no need to choose d tuples then permute the elements
#       within the arrays until a magic array is found.
#   This is the approach:
#       Create an array, splits, that contains all ways to split s into d elements.
#       Searches through splits for 2 * d + 2 tuples that obey these properties (d = 3 case):
#           Four items appear exactly two times in the 8 tuples;
#           Four items appear exactly two three in the 8 tuples; and,
#           One item appears exactly four times in the 8 tuples.
#       In addition:
#           At just about each step, there are checks to discard invalid items.
#           At just about each step, there are constraints to trim the search space.
#           At the beginning, an array is creating to allow quick searches whether an item is a integer square.
