#   This file contains the various split methods
#   To be a valid method of splitting s into d components, it must follow these conditions:
#       s = a + b + ... + d
#       a > b > ... > d
#       a, b, ..., d > 0
#       a, b, ..., d are all positive integers
#   Then, for most of these methods...
#       a, b, ..., d are integer squares
#
#   By the way, 'n?' represents the sum from 1 to n.
#       In terms of Python, it is sum(range(1, n + 1))
